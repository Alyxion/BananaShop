# Project Rules

## External References

- **No external CDN or remote resource references allowed** — all assets (fonts, icons, CSS, JS libraries) must be self-hosted in the `static/` directory. This is a strict requirement due to tracking concerns.
- Cleanly attribute licenses of any added third-party sources (e.g., in a `LICENSES` file or inline comments).
